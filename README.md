# 🧠 Text-to-Image Generation using GANs and Diffusion Models

This project focuses on generating realistic images from textual descriptions using deep learning techniques, specifically **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Diffusion Models**.

It was developed as part of an internship exploring advanced applications of AI in creative and generative tasks.

## 🆚 GANs vs Diffusion Models

| Criteria         | GANs                           | Diffusion Models                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Training         | Faster, but unstable           | Slower, but more stable             |
| Output Quality   | May suffer from artifacts      | Produces high-quality, fine details |
| Complexity       | Moderate                       | Higher computational cost           |
| Use Case         | Real-time generation           | High-fidelity creative content      |
